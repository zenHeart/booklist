# [浮生一日](https://movie.douban.com/subject/5387041/)

导演从全球征稿 2010 年 7.24 日的视频，汇总成了这部电影。

## 片段

这是作为最后一个片段出现的视频，一个女生周六刚上完夜班，
感叹今天没有发生任何精彩的事情，但是最后一段话她说感觉自己经历了涅槃。
而这段视频恰巧也作为压轴出现在了这部伟大的记录片里，This is life!

```
It's nearly midnight now, and I'm running out of time ot make this.
I worked all day long. On a Staturday! Yeah, I know.The sad part is,
I spend all day long hoping for something amazing to happen, something great, 
some thing appreciate this day, to be part of it, and to... show the world that there's
something great that can happen every daya of yout life, in everyone's life.
but the truth is ,it doesn't always happen, and for me today, all day long, nothing really happened.
I want people to know that i'm here, I don't wanna cease to exist, I'm not gonna sit here and
tell you that I'm this great person because, beacause I don't think I am, at all.
I think I'm a normal girl, Normal life, Not interesting enough, to know anything about,
but I want to be, and today even though..., even though nothing great really happened,
tonight I feel as if something great happened.
